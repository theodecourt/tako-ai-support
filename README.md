**Best use case:**  
This chatbot is designed for B2B payroll and HR scenarios involving operational, legal, or financial risk.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains:

- The **AWS Lambda handler** responsible for orchestrating message processing  
- All **LLM prompts** 

⚠️ **Important:**  
This repository is **not meant to be run locally**.

The system relies on managed AWS services including:

- API Gateway  
- AWS Lambda  
- Amazon Bedrock (LLM + Agents)  
- DynamoDB (mutex + metadata storage)  
- Amazon S3 (knowledge base for RAG)  
- Z-API (WhatsApp integration)

As a result, the code here should be read as a **reference implementation**, not as a standalone application.
